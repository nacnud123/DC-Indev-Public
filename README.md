# DC Indev

DC Indev is a Minecraft-inspired voxel engine built from scratch in C# using OpenTK. It features procedural terrain with caves and trees, entity AI, lighting, particles, and a full block inventory. This was created as an exploration of building a voxel game with no game engine. Here you will find the latest build of the game along with the source code.

## Features

- Procedural world generation with mountains, caves, trees, and vegetation
- Chunk-based rendering with frustum culling
- Sunlight and block light propagation
- 28+ block types including ores, plants, and decoratives
- Pig entities with A* pathfinding and wandering AI
- Block breaking/placing with particle effects
- Smoke particles
- ImGui-based UI with main menu, pause screen, and inventory
- Fly mode and survival mode
- Configurable world size
